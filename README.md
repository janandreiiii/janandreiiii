# Hi there, I'm Jan Andreiiii! 👋

It looks like the service you tried to use for tracking profile views is currently unavailable. As an alternative, you can use a different service to track profile views or simply omit this feature.

### Alternative Profile View Counter

You can use a GitHub profile view counter from [shields.io](https://shields.io/). Here's how you can integrate it into your README:

1. Replace the broken profile views badge link with a new one from shields.io.

2. Update your README.md with the new badge URL.

Here's the revised README.md content:
